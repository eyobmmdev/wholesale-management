"""
ViewSets for CustomerIncome, FactoryPayment, and GeneralExpense models.

CustomerIncome and FactoryPayment have auto records (from sales/purchases)
and manual records (created by owner). Auto records cannot be edited
or deleted through these endpoints — they are managed by their parent
sale/purchase. Manual records can be freely edited and deleted.

GeneralExpense records are always manually created and can be fully managed.
